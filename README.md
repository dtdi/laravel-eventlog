The **laravel-eventlog** package is designed to facilitate the extraction of process mining event log data within Laravel applications. If you’re working on a Laravel project that involves any central activity table this package might be helpful. Whether you’re using popular packages like spatie/laravel-activitylog or snipe/snipe-it, laravel-eventlog has you covered.

Process mining is a data-driven discipline that aims to extract valuable insights from event logs generated by information systems. These event logs capture the execution of processes within an organization, providing a wealth of information about how activities are performed, their sequences, and potential bottlenecks. Here’s where OCEL (Object-Centric Event Log) comes into play: OCELs serve as the foundation for object-centric process mining (OCPM).
Unlike traditional event logs, which focus on process instances (cases) and their associated activities, OCELs take a different perspective.
In OCELs, each event is related to specific objects (e.g., orders, customers, products) rather than just process instances.
These objects can be uniquely identified instances (e.g., “order-123”) and have associated attributes that may change over time.
OCELs allow us to capture more detailed information about objects and their relationships.
